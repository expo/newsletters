Also check out Avik's talk from @scale 2014 for more.

Flow is optional with React Native, but it is used throughout the core so you will probably run into it if you dig into the internals at all. If you haven't given it a chance yet, I'd highly recommend trying it out.`,

Looking at a list of issues doesn't do much to give you the big picture for what needs work on a repository. So I put together a little app that pulls the issues from Github, parses out the tags and provides a few graphs & data tables to help us better understand the current state of affairs.

The first graphs just sum up the occurrences of tags across issues. The last data table uses number of unique commenters on an issue as a proxy to determine its importance to the community.

If you have any ideas for how we can change this to get more insight, ping me @notbrent on Twitter or create an issue on this repo.
